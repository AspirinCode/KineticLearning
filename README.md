# Kinetic Learning
Learnin Kinetic Models from Time Series Proteomics and Metabolomics Data.  There are two main files in this repository: 'Create Data Set.ipynb' and 'KineticLearning.ipynb'. The first creates simulated data sets, and the second builds and analyzes models generated from proteomic and metabolomic data.  Install the correct dependencies for the project, open the notebook of interest. Set the parameters at the top of the file, and run!  Note: These notebooks often take a long time to run (several hours) and have not been optomized for speed of execution.
